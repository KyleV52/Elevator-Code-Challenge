<h1>Elevator Code Challenge</h1>

<h2>Steps to run:</h2>
Double check you have node installed by running

```
node -v
```

Next, to get started run

```
node elevator.js
```

The script will then prompt you to enter a starting floor number

```
Enter the starting floor for the elevator (single number):
```

Once you've done that, it will now prompt you to enter floors you'd like visit separated by commas

```
Enter the floors you would like to visit (number, comma-separated):
```

Lastly, the script will output the floors visited in order and total time travled that will look something like:

```
Total Travel Time: 230
Floors Visited in Order: 1,4,8,12,24
```
